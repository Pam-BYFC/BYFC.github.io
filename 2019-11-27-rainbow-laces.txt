BYFC is supporting and promoting the Stonewall Rainbow Laces campaign from 22 November to 8 December. Wear your rainbow laces to show your support for LGBT people in sport.

Did you know 4 in 10 LGBT people don’t think sport is welcoming.
Sport has an amazing power to bring people together. Following and taking part can give us community, energy and a sense of belonging.
That’s why we as BYFC should play our part to make sport everyone’s game.
Challenge anti-LGBT language. Celebrate LGBT people in sport. 

Wear your Rainbow Laces and show you care.
